Notion is a block based notes app that contains most of the markdown elements + some special elements like the database.

Notion's structure can be broken down into three main components: Blocks -> Pages -> Databases.

**Blocks** are pieces of content like text, images, tables, etc.

* They can be as small as a single character or contain the entire script of Shrek 2.

**Pages** are the containers for your blocks. They can also contain subpages.

* Subpages are just regular pages but nested within page, creating a hierarchical structure.

**Databases** are collections of pages that can be sorted, filtered, or visualized based on properties you define.

* Databases are the core of what makes Notion so powerful and what we’ll be using to create a CMS.
