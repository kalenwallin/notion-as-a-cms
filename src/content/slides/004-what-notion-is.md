Notion is a block based notes app that contains most of the markdown elements + some special elements like the database.

Notion's structure can be broken down into three main components: Blocks -> Pages -> Databases.

**Blocks** are pieces of content like text and media.

**Pages** are the containers for your blocks. 

* Pages can be nested within each other, creating a hierachical structure.

**Databases** are collections of pages that can be sorted, filtered, or visualized based on properties you define.

* Databases are the core of what makes Notion so powerful and what weâ€™ll be using to create a CMS.
